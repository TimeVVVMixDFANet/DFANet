## Introduction
🏆 **DFANnet**, a novel crossdomain forecasting framework that unifies time and frequency representations via a domain-mixing attention mechanism.**.

## Get Started

1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    > If you are using **Python 3.8**, please change the `sktime` version in `requirements.txt` to `0.29.1`
2. Download data. You can download all datasets from [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1NF7VEefXCmXuWNbnNe858WvQAkJ_7wuP&export=download), [Baidu Driver](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg&pwd=i9iy) or [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wentixiaogege/time-series-dataset). **All the datasets are well pre-processed** and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/etth1/etth1_96.sh
bash ......
```

## Main Results


We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and efficiency of DFANnet, covering long-term forecasting, including 6 real-world benchmarks and 9 baselines.
**🏆 DFANnet achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in all benchmarks**, covering a large variety of series with different frequencies, variate numbers and real-world scenarios.

### Long-term Forecasting

We evaluate our method against a wide range of SOTA architectures. Following the design of the state-of-the-art TimeMixer++ [26 ], the input length is not fixed; instead, it is treated as a tunable hyperparameter and optimized separately
for each dataset and each prediction horizon 𝑇 ∈ {96, 192, 336, 720}. Baseline results are primarily collected from TimeMixer++ [ 26 ] or
the original papers.. Detailed settings are provided in Appendix A.1. Table 2 summarizes the forecasting performance across all datasets and baselines. Compared with strong baselines in the frequency domain (SimpleTM Chen et al. (2025)) and the time domain (CATS Lu et al. (2024)), both of which employ complex Transformer architectures, our proposed model DFANnet achieves superior performance. Compared with TimeMixer Wang et al. (2024a) and ATFNet Ye & Gao (2024), our model delivers better results, suggesting that multi-scale trend–season decomposition alone or modeling the time and frequency domains separately without interaction is insufficient. DFANnet attains the best results on most forecast horizons (**18/24 for MSE and 19/24 for MAE**). These findings highlight that integrating both domains is essential for capturing underlying patterns in diverse time series data.
